# To load a preset with new IR data ...
#
# 1) Send property 0x200n (n = property page number) to load FLASH data into RAM for preset N.
# 2) Send property 0x4iii (iii = line number) to send five 32-bit words of IR data.
# 3) Repeat #2 incrementing iii for each five-word upload.
# 4) Send property 0x210n (n = property page number) to save new IR data FLASH for preset N.
