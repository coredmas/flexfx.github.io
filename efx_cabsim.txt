# Three-stage tube preamp. Each stage implements a triode preamp model. The three stages are
# followed by a grapic EQ. Preamp and tone parameters range from 1 (lowest frequency, minimum
# level, etc) to 9 (highest frequency, maximum level, etc) with 5 being the middle or neutral
# value.
#
# The FlexFX audio sample rate must be set to 192 kHz. The guitar samples are up-sampled to 960
# kHz for non-linear preamp/tube model processing and then down-sampled back to 192 kHz. Therefore
# the ADC, DAC and USB audio sample rates are all 192 khz.
#
# Each preamp stage incorporates adjustable pre-filtering (bass attenuation), a 12AX7 amplifier
# model with slew-rate limiting and adjustable bias, and post-filtering, all creating a simple
# 12AX7-based guitar preamp stage. The graphic EQ is at the end of the three-stage-preamp chain and
# is used as the final tone-shaping component (a.k.a the preamp's the tone stack).
#
# All FlexFX apps support the standard FlexFX properties via the FlexFX framework ...
